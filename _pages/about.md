Hi, I’m Yuqi Peng (彭瑀琦). I am an M.S. student in Computer Science at Northeastern University, and I expect to complete my degree in April 2026. Before coming to Northeastern, I earned a B.S. in Mathematics and a B.A. in Economics from the University of Colorado Denver. 

In 2025, I worked as a Research Assistant at MMLab, Shenzhen Institutes of Advanced Technology, supervised by [Prof. Shifeng Chen](https://people.ucas.ac.cn/~sfchen?language=en) and [Prof. Jianzhuang Liu](https://mmlab.siat.ac.cn/jzliu_en). This experience deepened my interest in generative models and vision-language models, and it also sparked my curiosity about understanding the behavior of foundational models. My research aims to build models that are robust, controllable, and interpretable. I plan to apply for PhD programs starting in Fall 2026.

Outside of my studies, I enjoy playing badminton and am a member of the Northeastern University badminton team.
